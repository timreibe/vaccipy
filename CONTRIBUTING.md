#### We have an official Slack:

    * Use the `#chat` channel for general questions and discussion about Vaccipy
    * Use the `#development` channel for more dev related stuff
    * Use the `#continous-integration` channel for everything build, deployment, workflow and installer related
    * Use the `#gui` channel for everything related to our graphical user interface
    * Important announcements will be shared in the `#important` channel
    
    Even though Slack is a chat service, sometimes it takes several hours for community members to respond &mdash; please be patient!
